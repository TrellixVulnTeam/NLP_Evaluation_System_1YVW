Verification:Verification is a term that refers to the set of activities which ensure that software implements a specific function.Validation: It refers to the set of activities which ensure that software that has been built according to the need of clients.!!
Debugging is the process that results in the removal of error. It is very important part of the successful testing.!!
In the software, development security is always first. So if the execution of the program is slow then, I will try to identify the reason out ways to its time complexity.!!
There many l ways to keep track of requirements. Two commonly used are:Make a requirements specifications document to list all of the requirements.Create an excel sheet the list down the requirement, type, dependency, priority, etc.!!
