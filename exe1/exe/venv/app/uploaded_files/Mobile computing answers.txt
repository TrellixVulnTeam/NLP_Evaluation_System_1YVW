Antennas:-As the name wireless already indicates, this communication mode involves ‘getting rid’ of wires and transmitting signals through space without guidance. We do not need any ‘medium’ (such as an ether) for the transport of electromagnetic waves. Antennas couple electromagnetic energy to and from space to and from a wire or coaxial cable (or any other appropriate conductor). A theoretical reference antenna is the isotropic radiator, a point in space radiating equal power in all directions, i.e., all points with equal power are located on a sphere with the antenna as its center. The radiation pattern is symmetric in all directions two dimensional.Signal propagation:- Like wired networks, wireless communication networks also have senders and receivers of signals. However, in connection with signal propagation, these two networks exhibit considerable differences. In wireless networks, the signal has no wire to determine the direction of propagation, whereas signals in wired networks only travel along the wire (which can be twisted pair copper wires, a coax cable, but also a fiber etc.). As long as the wire is not interrupted or damaged, it typically exhibits the same characteristics at each point. One can precisely determine the behavior of a signal travelling along this wire, e.g., received power depending on the length. For wireless transmission, this predictable behavior is only valid in a vacuum, i.e., without matter between the sender and the receiver.!!
A handover is a process in telecommunications and mobile communications in which a connected cellular call or a data session is transferred from one cell site (base station) to another without disconnecting the session. Cellular services are based on mobility and handover, allowing the user to be moved from one cell site range to another or to be switched to the nearest cell site for better performance.Handovers are a core element in planning and deploying cellular networks. It allows users to create data sessions or connect phone calls on the move. This process keeps the calls and data sessions connected even if a user moves from one cell site to another.!!
Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) is used for allocating a separated space to users in wireless networks. A typical application involves assigning an optimal base station to a mobile phone user. The mobile phone may receive several base stations with different quality. The basis for the SDMA algorithm is formed by cells and sectorized antennas which constitute the infrastructure implementing space division multiplexing (SDM).For wireless communication, multiplexing can be carried out in four dimensions: space, time, frequency, and code. In this field, the task of multiplexing is to assign space, time, frequency, and code to each communication channel with a minimum of interference and a maximum of medium utilization.!!
Cyclical repetition of data:-A broadcast sender of data does not know when a receiver starts to listen to the transmission. While for radio or television this is no problem (if you do not listen you will not get the message), transmission of other important information, such as traffic or weather conditions, has to be repeated to give receivers a chance to receive this information after having listened for a certain amount of time (like the news every full hour). The cyclical repetition of data blocks sent via broadcast is often called a broadcast disk according to the project in Acharya (1995) or data carousel, e.g., according to the DAB/DVB standards (ETSI, 2002). Different patterns are possible (The sender repeats the three data blocks A, B, and C in a cycle. Using a flat disk, all blocks are repeated one after another. Every block is transmitted for an equal amount of time, the average waiting time for receiving a block is the same for A, B, and C.!!
There are two different kinds of mobility: user mobility and device portability. User mobility refers to a user who has access to the same or similar telecommunication services at different places, i.e., the user can be mobile, and the services will follow him or her.With device portability, the communication device moves (with or without a user). Many mechanisms in the network and inside the device have to make sure that communication is still possible while the device is moving. A typical example for systems supporting device portability is the mobile phone system, where the system itself hands the device from one radio transmitter (also called a base station) to the next if the signal becomes too weak.!!
Signal propagation:- Like wired networks, wireless communication networks also have senders and receivers of signals. However, in connection with signal propagation, these two networks exhibit considerable differences. In wireless networks, the signal has no wire to determine the direction of propagation, whereas signals in wired networks only travel along the wire (which can be twisted pair copper wires, a coax cable, but also a fiber etc.). As long as the wire is not interrupted or damaged, it typically exhibits the same characteristics at each point. One can precisely determine the behavior of a signal travelling along this wire, e.g., received power depending on the length. For wireless transmission, this predictable behavior is only valid in a vacuum, i.e., without matter between the sender and the receiver.!!
Cellular systems:- Cellular systems for mobile communications implement SDM. Each transmitter,typically called a base station, covers a certain area, a cell. Cell radii can varyfrom tens of meters in buildings, and hundreds of meters in cities, up to tens ofkilometers in the countryside. The shape of cells are never perfect circles orhexagons but depend on the environment (buildings,mountains, valleys etc.), on weather conditions, and sometimes even on systemload. Typical systems using this approach are mobile telecommunication systems.!! Advantages of cellular systems with small cells are the following:Higher capacity: Implementing SDM allows frequency reuse. If one transmitter is far away from another, i.e., outside the interference range, it can reuse the same frequencies. As most mobile phone systems assign frequencies to certain users (or certain hopping patterns), this frequency is blocked for other users. But frequencies are a scarce resource and, the number of concurrent users per cell is very limited. Huge cells do not allow for more users. On the contrary, they are limited to less possible users per km2. This is also the reason for using very small cells in cities where man more people use mobile phones.Less transmission power: While power aspects are not a big problem for base stations, they are indeed problematic for mobile stations. A receiver far away from a base station would need much more transmit power than the current few Watts. But energy is a serious problem for mobile handheld devices.Local interference only: Having long distances between sender and receiver results in even more interference problems. With small cells, mobile stations and base stations only have to deal with ‘local’ interference.Robustness: Cellular systems are decentralized and so, more robust against the failure of single components. If one antenna fails, this only influences communication within a small area.!!
Bearer services:-GSM specifies different mechanisms for data transmission, the original GSM allowing for data rates of up to 9600 bit/s for non-voice services. Bearer services permit transparent and nontransparent, synchronous or asynchronous data transmission. Transparent bearer services only use the functions of the physical layer (layer 1) to transmit data. Data transmission has a constant delay and throughput if no transmission errors occur. The only mechanism to increase transmission quality is the use of forward error correction (FEC), which codes redundancy into the data stream and helps to reconstruct the original data in case of transmission errors. Non-transparent bearer services use protocols of layers two and three to implement error correction and flow control. These services use the transparent bearer services, adding a radio link protocol (RLP). This protocol comprises mechanisms of high-level data link control (HDLC), (Halsall, 1996) and special selective-reject mechanisms to trigger retransmission of erroneous data. Tele services:-GSM mainly focuses on voice-oriented tele services. These comprise encrypted voice transmission, message services, and basic data communication with terminals as known from the PSTN or ISDN (e.g., fax). Another service offered by GSM is the emergency number. The same number can be used throughout country. This service is mandatory for all providers and free of charge. This connection also has the highest priority, possibly pre-empting other connections, and will automatically be set up with the closest emergency center. A useful service for very simple message transfer is the short message service (SMS), which offers transmission of messages of up to 160 characters. Supplementary services:- In addition to tele and bearer services, GSM providers can offer supplementary services.Similar to ISDN networks, these services offer various enhancements for the standard telephony service, and may vary from provider to provider. Typical services are user identification, call redirection, or forwarding of ongoing calls. Standard ISDN features such as closed user groups and multiparty communication may be available. Closed user groups are of special interest to companies because they allow, for example, a company-specific GSM sub-network, to which only members of the group have access!!
Applications:-1. Vehicles:-Today’s cars already comprise some, but tomorrow’s cars will comprise many wireless communication systems and mobility aware applications. Music, news, road conditions, weather reports, and other broadcast information are received via digital audio broadcasting (DAB) with 1.5 Mbit/s. For personal communication, a universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) phone might be available offering voice and data connectivity with 384 Kbit/s. For remote areas, satellite communication can be used, while the current position of the car is determined via the global positioning system (GPS). Cars driving in the same area build a local ad-hoc network for the fast exchange of information in emergency situations or to help each other keep a safe distance. In case of an accident, not only will the airbag be triggered, but the police and ambulance service will be informed via an emergency call to a service provider. Cars with this technology are already available. In the future, cars will also inform other cars about accidents via the ad-hoc network to help them slow down in time, even before a driver can recognize an accident. Buses, trucks, and trains are already transmitting maintenance and logistic information to their home base, which helps to improve organization (fleet management), and saves time and money. 2. Emergencies:- Just imagine the possibilities of an ambulance with a high-quality wireless connection to a hospital. Vital information about injured persons can be sent to the hospital from the scene of the accident. All the necessary steps for this particular type of accident can be prepared and specialists can be consulted for an early diagnosis. Wireless networks are the only means of communication in the case of natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes. In the worst cases, only decentralized, wireless ad-hoc networks survive. The breakdown of all cabling not only implies the failure of the standard wired telephone system, but also the crash of all mobile phone systems requiring base stations!3. Business:-A travelling salesman today needs instant access to the company’s database: to ensure that files on his or her laptop reflect the current situation, to enable the company to keep track of all activities of their travelling employees, to keep databases consistent etc. With wireless access, the laptop can be turned into a true mobile office, but efficient and powerful synchronization mechanisms are needed to ensure data consistency. At home, the laptop connects via a WLAN or LAN and DSL to the Internet. Leaving home requires a handover to another technology, e.g., to an enhanced version of GSM, as soon as the WLAN coverage ends. Due to interference and other factors discussed in chapter 2, data rates drop while cruising at higher speed. Gas stations may offer WLAN hot spots as well as gas. Trains already offer support for wireless connectivity. Several more handovers to different technologies might be necessary before reaching the office. No matter when and where, mobile communications should always offer as good connectivity as possible to the internet, the company’s intranet, or the telephone network. 4. Replacement of wired networks In some cases, wireless networks can also be used to replace wired networks, e.g., remote sensors, for tradeshows, or in historic buildings. Due to economic reasons, it is often impossible to wire remote sensors for weather forecasts, earthquake detection, or to provide environmental information. Wireless connections, e.g., via satellite, can help in this situation. Tradeshows need a highly dynamic infrastructure, but cabling takes a long time and frequently proves to be too inflexible. Many computer fairs use WLANs as a replacement for cabling. Other cases for wireless networks are computers, sensors, or information displays in historical buildings, where excess cabling may destroy valuable walls or floors. Wireless access points in a corner of the room can represent a solution.!!
DECT:-Another fully digital cellular network is the digital enhanced cordless telecommunications (DECT) system specified by ETSI (2002, 1998j, k), (DECT Forum, 2002). Formerly also called digital European cordless telephone and digital European cordless telecommunications, DECT replaces older analog cordless phone systemssuch as CT1 and CT1+. These analog systems only ensured security to a limited extent as they did not use encryption for data transmission and only offered a relatively low capacity. DECT is also a more powerful alternative to the digital system CT2, which is mainly used in the UK (the DECT standard works throughout Europe), and has even been selected as one of the 3G candidates in the IMT-2000 family. DECT is mainly used in offices, on campus, at trade shows, or in the home. Furthermore, access points to the PSTN can be established within, e.g., railway stations, large government buildings and hospitals, offering a much cheaper telephone service compared to a GSM system. DECT could also be used to bridge the last few hundred meters between a new network operator and customers. Using this ‘small range’ local loop, new companies can offer their service without having their own lines installed in the streets. DECT systems offer many different interworking units, e.g., with GSM, ISDN, or data networks. Currently, over 100 million DECT units are in use (DECT, 2002). A big difference between DECT and GSM exists in terms of cell diameter and cell capacity. While GSM is designed for outdoor use with a cell diameter of up to 70 km, the range of DECT is limited to about 300 m from the base station (only around 50 m are feasible inside buildings depending on the walls). Due to this limited range and additional multiplexing techniques, DECT can offer its service to some 10,000 people within one km2. This is a typical scenario within a big city, where thousands of offices are located in skyscrapers close together. DECT also uses base stations, but these base stations together with a mobile station are in a price range of €100 compared to several €10,000 for a GSM base station. GSM base stations can typically not be used by individuals for private networks. One reason is licensing as all GSM frequencies have been licensed to network operators. DECT can also handle handover, but it was not designed to work at a higher speed (e.g., up to 250 km/h like GSM systems). Devices handling GSM and DECT exist but have never been a commercial success. DECT works at a frequency range of 1880–1990 MHz offering 120 full duplex channels. Time division duplex (TDD) is applied using 10 ms frames. The frequency range is subdivided into 10 carrier frequencies using FDMA, each frame being divided into 24 slots using TDMA. For the TDD mechanism 12 slots are used as uplink, 12 slots as downlink (see Figure 3.4). The digital modulation scheme is GMSK – each station has an average transmission power of only 10 mW with a maximum of 250 mW.!!
