The advantages of using cloud computing are Data backup and storage of data,Powerful server capabilities,SaaS ( Software as a service),Information technology sandboxing capabilities,Increase in productivity!!
The different deployment models in cloud computing are Private Cloud,Public Cloud,Community Cloud,Hybrid Cloud!!
Mobile computing uses the same concept as cloud computing.Cloud computing becomes active with the data with the help of internet rather than individual device. It provides users with the data which they have to retrieve on demand.In mobile, the applications runs on the remote server and gives user the access for storage and manage.!!
Utility computing allows the user to pay only for what they are using. It is a plug-in managed by an organization which decides what type of services has to be deployed from the cloud.Most organizations prefer hybrid strategy.!!
To secure your data while transporting them from one place to another, check that there is no leak with the encryption key implemented with the data you are sending.!!
Identity management: It authorizes the application services.Access control: permission has to be provided to the users so that they can control the access of another user who is entering into the cloud environment.Authentication and Authorization: Allows only the authorized and authenticated user only to access the data and applications!!
The different layers used by cloud architecture are CLC or Cloud Controller,Walrus,Cluster Controller,SC or Storage  Controller,NC or Node Controller!!
In Cloud Computing, systems integrator provides the strategy of the complicated process used to design a cloud platform. Integrator allows to create more accurate hybrid and  private cloud network, as integrators have all the knowledge about the data center creation.!!
“Eucalyptus” is an open source software infrastructure in cloud computing, which is used to implement clusters in cloud computing platform. It is used to build public, hybrid and private clouds. It has the ability to produce your own data center into a private cloud and allows you to use its functionality to many other organizations.!!
The requirement of virtualization platform in implementing cloud is to Manage the service level policies,Cloud Operating System,Virtualization platforms helps to keep the backend level and user level concepts different from each other!!
